# Security Implementations

This document outlines the basic security considerations implemented in this web project.

## 1. Form Validation

* **Client-side validation** is applied to all form fields (name, ID, department, email, and gender).
* Email validation uses a regex pattern to ensure proper format.
* Radio buttons are checked for gender selection.
* Fields highlight errors and display appropriate feedback.

## 2. Secure Asset Loading

* All assets (e.g., Bootstrap, images) are loaded over HTTPS to prevent mixed content vulnerabilities.

## 3. XSS Prevention

* All user inputs are validated and not injected into the DOM or server-side code without sanitization (this is a static front-end implementation).

## 4. Accessibility and Safe UX

* Feedback messages are provided for invalid form inputs.
* Buttons and inputs are keyboard-accessible and labeled for screen readers.

> Note: For full production-grade security, additional server-side validation, HTTPS-only deployment, CSRF protection, and sanitization would be required.
